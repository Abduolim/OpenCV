# Real-Time Face Recognition with Webcam

This is a Python script that uses the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to perform real-time face recognition using a webcam feed. It captures video from the default camera, detects faces in each frame, and compares them with a known face encoding to determine if the face belongs to a specific person.
